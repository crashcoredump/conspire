;;; Commentary:

;; Let's use git for real-time collaborative editing!

;;; TODO:

;; In its current state, it's very dangerous to start a conspire
;; session and then switch buffers, since the timer is not yet buffer
;; local. Watch out!

;;; Code:

(defvar conspire-interval 0.33
  "Number of seconds to wait before syncing with conspire.")

(defvar conspire-timer nil
  "A timer to activate conspire synchronizing.")

(defun conspire-mode ()
  "Activate conspire-mode for real-time collaborative editing."
  (interactive)
  (set (make-local-variable 'conspire-timer)
       (run-with-idle-timer conspire-interval
                            :repeat 'conspire-sync-buffer)))

(defun conspire-sync-buffer ()
  "Synchronize buffer with Conspire repository."
  (when (buffer-modified-p)
    (save-buffer)
    (shell-command (format "git add %s && git commit -m \"conspire\""
                           buffer-file-name)))
  (revert-buffer nil t))
