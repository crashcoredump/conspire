;;; Commentary:

;; Let's use git for real-time collaborative editing!

;;; Installation:

;; Copy to your .emacs.d directory and add this to your init file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'conspire-mode "conspire" "Collaborative editing" t)

;;; TODO:

;; Automatically launch conspire executable.
;; Don't bother with *Async Shell Command* output buffer
;; Color lines based on which conspirator wrote them?

;;; Code:

(defvar conspire-interval 0.25
  "Number of seconds to wait before syncing with conspire.")

(defvar conspire-timer nil
  "A timer to activate conspire synchronizing.")

(defun conspire-sync-buffer ()
  "Synchronize buffer with Conspire repository."
  (when conspire-mode
    (when (buffer-modified-p)
      (save-buffer)
      (shell-command (format "git add %s && git commit -m \"conspire\""
                             buffer-file-name)))
    (revert-buffer nil t) ;; revert resets local variables; heh
    (setq conspire-mode t)))

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode conspire-mode
  "Toggle conspire-mode for real-time collaborative editing.

If the current buffer isn't part of a conspiracy session, a new
session will be started."
  :lighter "-conspire"
  (unless (file-exists-p (concat (file-name-directory buffer-file-name)
                                 ".git/conspire"))
    (shell-command (format "conspire %s >& /dev/null &"
                           (file-name-directory buffer-file-name))))
  (setq conspire-timer
        (or conspire-timer
            (run-with-idle-timer conspire-interval :repeat
