Conspire is a real-time collaborative editing platform using Git as a
transport layer.

You don't actually use Conspire directly; you would invoke it through
an editor interface. See lib/conspire/support to see which editors are
supported.

== Installation

* sudo gem install technomancy-conspire --source=http://gems.github.com

Once a proper release has happened:

* sudo gem install conspire
